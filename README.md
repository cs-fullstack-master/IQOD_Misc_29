### FIZZBUZZ Revisited...

User inputs the ending value (e.g. 100) 

Your code should start at 1 and then iterate each number up to the maximum
```
If the current number is evenly divisible by 3 you should print "FIZZ" and the number
If the current number is evenly divisible by 5 you should print "BUZZ" and the number
If the current number is evenly divisible by both 3 and 5 you should print "FIZZBUZZ" and the number BOTH to the screen and to the file 'fizzbuzz.txt'
Otherwise, just print the number
```
